# GPACalculator
Simple Android app to calculate GPA

**Introduction**<br />
This app is a simple android application written by me to ease the calculation of GPA. A student can simply input his/her grades into the application and the Calculation would
be displayed immediately.
This is my first android application and I have noticed that the UI is terrible and I will improve it as I learn along on the Android App UI designing.
